	<h4 class="center">Context:</h4>
	  <div class="superpad"><p><span class="tab"></span>The Teamsters Union is a collection of unions mainly in logistical industries. The UPS Teamsters Union specifically is comprised of 340,000 members and UPS is the largest employer in the Teamsters union. The UPS Teamsters have a contract that lasts 5 years that dictates wages and other worker issues. The current contract is set to expire on July 31st and both UPS and the Teamsters walked away from the negotiation table on July 5th <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/teamsters-says-ups-has-walked-away-negotiations-2023-07-05/">(1)</a>. On June 16th 97% of teamsters voted to approve a strike if an agreement was not reached by the 31st. In preparation for the strike UPS Teamsters have been practice picketing to help prepare and motivate the union members. There has been a large show of support from large political figures. Bernie Sanders and 200 of his colleagues wrote a letter in strong support of the UPS Teamsters <a href="https://twitter.com/SenSanders/status/1681723388597813248">(2)</a>, and President Biden has voiced support for unions <a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1681684067270508549">(3)</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1681666450136727553">(4)</a>. With mounting support for a strike UPS stockholders are becoming concerned. The New York City Comptroller wrote a scathing letter to UPS to “make an offer to the Teamsters that addresses the real concerns of the part-time employees at UPS” <a href="https://comptroller.nyc.gov/reports/letter-to-ups-ceo-carol-tome-about-extended-strike/">(5)</a>. With all these rising pressures UPS has agreed to reenter negotiations on July 19th <a href="https://teamster.org/2023/07/ups-bows-to-teamster-pressure-negotiations-to-resume-next-week/">(6)</a> <a href="https://about.ups.com/us/en/newsroom/press-releases/people-led/ups--teamsters-negotiations-to-resume-next-week.html">(7)</a> . There are some who speculate that UPS won’t offer their best deal until the “11th hour” <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2023/07/05/ups-isnt-going-to-give-its-best-deal-until-the-eleventh-hour-says-donald-broughton.html">(8)</a> or the last possible moment. This could introduce a situation where come August 1st there is only a Tentative Agreement (TA) and many Teamsters do not feel comfortable working under a TA and may still strike. The optimal situation would be for a contract that was voted on before the previous contract has expired, but as of July 20th this seems unlikely. In a leaked UPS counterproposal draft <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UPSers/comments/14h9x8y/ups_counterproposal_to_the_union_got_leaked_today/">(9)</a> UPS offers to reduce wage increases in terms of the last contract. Typically, with the increase of productivity and inflation wages should be increasing every coming year. UPS doing the opposite is unprecedented and likely shows why a strike was deemed necessary. There is a lot of uncertainty about whether there will be a strike. There is a solid chance that negotiations will break down again, but UPS is facing mounting demands from stockholders, politicians, and the public to cave to union demands.<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/teamsters-says-ups-has-walked-away-negotiations-2023-07-05/">1</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/SenSanders/status/1681723388597813248">2</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1681684067270508549">3</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1681666450136727553">4</a> <a href="https://comptroller.nyc.gov/reports/letter-to-ups-ceo-carol-tome-about-extended-strike/">5</a> <a href="https://teamster.org/2023/07/ups-bows-to-teamster-pressure-negotiations-to-resume-next-week/">6</a> <a href="https://about.ups.com/us/en/newsroom/press-releases/people-led/ups--teamsters-negotiations-to-resume-next-week.html">7</a> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2023/07/05/ups-isnt-going-to-give-its-best-deal-until-the-eleventh-hour-says-donald-broughton.html">8</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UPSers/comments/14h9x8y/ups_counterproposal_to_the_union_got_leaked_today/">9</a></p></div>

	<h4 class="center">Why Does This All Matter? </h4>
	  
	  <div class="superpad"><p><span class="tab"></span>UPS estimates that about 6% of Americas GDP flows through UPS <a href="https://apnews.com/article/b92dc20b095d1a62958b8c6a11d061bb ">(1)</a>. If the strike happens, non-union workers will have to take the jobs of the union members. UPS has been training new employees in preparation for the strike <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ups-strike-union-training-teamsters-b92dc20b095d1a62958b8c6a11d061bb">(2)</a>, and UPS office administration and managers are also being trained to cover for the union employees <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ups-strike-managers-training-keep-packages-moving-if-teamsters-negotations-fail-2023-7">(3)</a>. These temp workers will not be able to maintain the same level of throughput without the years of experience the UPS Teamsters bring to the table. This is not the first time that the UPS Teamsters have gone on strike. In 1997 UPS was attempting to replace worker’s pensions with a 401k and create more part-time jobs instead of full-time jobs. 185,000 UPS Teamsters went on strike for 15 days and caused UPS to lose 600 million in profits <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/19/us/teamsters-and-ups-agree-on-a-5-year-contract-plan-to-end-strike-after-15-days.html">(4)</a>. The strike had many shippers shifting to the Post Office and Federal Express and this caused the Post Office and Federal Express to become overloaded themselves. We will likely see some parallels in todays strike but on a larger scale since the union has nearly doubled in membership. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/b92dc20b095d1a62958b8c6a11d061bb ">1</a> <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ups-strike-union-training-teamsters-b92dc20b095d1a62958b8c6a11d061bb">2</a> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ups-strike-managers-training-keep-packages-moving-if-teamsters-negotations-fail-2023-7">3</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/19/us/teamsters-and-ups-agree-on-a-5-year-contract-plan-to-end-strike-after-15-days.html">4</a></p>

<h4 class="center">Union Demands:</h4>
	<h5 class="center">A/C in Trucks</h5>
		  <div class="superpad"><p><span class="tab"></span>UPS does not put A/C in their trucks. During the hot months trucks have been noted to reach up to 130 degrees in the air and up to 150 degrees on surfaces. These are unsafe conditions for workers. During 2015-2019 107 UPS workers were hospitalized because of heat related illnesses. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/06/14/1182147381/ups-workers-facing-extreme-heat-win-a-deal-to-get-air-conditioning-in-new-trucks#:~:text=Air conditioning systems will be,1, 2024.">1</a></p></div>
	
<h5 class="center">Two Tier Contracts </h5>
		  <div class="superpad"><p><span class="tab"></span>With a two-tier contract system in place new workers start at a lower wage and over x amount of time they will move to the second tier of wage. This sounds normal at first, but this creates a profit incentive to terminate long-term employees allowing corporations to save on wages as well as taking back non vested pension funds. A two-tier contract also incentivizes the hire of new employees. Newer employees are less likely to support a union thus reducing the bargaining power of the union. <a href="https://www.tdu.org/how_two_tier_contracts_hurt_workers_and_weaken_unions">1</a></p></div>
	
<h5 class="center">Part-Time Raise</h5>
		 <div class="superpad"><p><span class="tab"></span>Part-Time UPS employees are typically given the most unfavorably hours for the lowest pay. UPS workers have been creating more value for the company while receiving the same pay adjusted for inflation. This has allowed for UPS to bring in record profits during the Pandemic and these profits were not passed along to the UPS workers. The Teamsters hope to gain a new wage for part-time employees that reflects the increased profits as well as keeping UPS workers ahead of gig companies like Uber and Lyft. <a href="https://truthout.org/articles/ups-workers-prep-to-strike-for-demands-that-would-improve-lives-of-over-340000/">1</a></p></div>
