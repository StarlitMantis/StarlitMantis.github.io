<h1>Why You Should Care About the Teamsters Strike

<h3>A Brief Overview of the August 1st UPS Strike</h3>

	<h4>Bullets:</h4>
	<p>	&#62;Union Demands-	&#62; A/C in trucks, no two tier contract system, and a raise for part time employees.</p>
	<p>	&#62;On June 16, 97% of Teamsters Union Members voted to strike if their demands weren’t met in the new contract.</p>
	<p>	&#62;The previous contract will expire on July 31st meaning that the strike will begin August 1st since UPS and the Teamsters have walked away from the negotiating table.</p>
	<p>	&#62;UPS is training non-union workers (Scabs) in preparation for the strike.</p>
	<p>	&#62;340,000 Teamsters are expected to strike on August 1st. This will be the largest strike in American history.</p>

	<h4>Context:</h4>
	<p>The teamsters union is a collection of unions mainly in logistical industries. The UPS Teamster Union is comprised of 340,000 and UPS is the largest employer in the Teamsters union. The UPS Teamsters Union negotiates with UPS the specifics of the next contract when the previous one expires. The current contract is set to expire on July 31st. This is an issue since the Teamsters are using their collective bargaining power in what would be America’s largest strike. <a href="https://about.ups.com/ca/en/newsroom/press-releases/customer-first/ups-supports-the-administration-to-serve-the-economic-and-healthcare-interests-of-the-nation.html">1</a> </p>

	<h4>Why Does This All Matter? </h4>
	<p>UPS estimates that about 6% of Americas GDP flows through UPS (1). When the strike happens, non-union workers will have to take the jobs of the union members on strike. UPS has been training new employees in preparation for the strike, and management is expected to join in. However, this will not be able to maintain the same level of throughput that UPS has today. Looking back at the 1997 strike, it lasted 15 days. Every day that the teamsters strike the backlog of packages will become larger and the situation will become more dire. During the 1997 strike economists called for President Bill Clinton to utilize the Taft-Hartley Act to break the strike, but the public consensus at the time was pro-union and Clinton did not want to go against it. Considering that this will be the largest strike to happen in US history there will be a large outcry to break the strike for the sake of the US Economy. I believe that this is unlikely to happen since public support of unions has been at its highest since 1965 (2). <a href="https://apnews.com/article/b92dc20b095d1a62958b8c6a11d061bb">1</a> <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/union2.pdf">2</a> </p>

<h4>Union Demands:</h4>
	<h4>A/C in Trucks</h4>
	<p>UPS does not put A/C in their trucks. During the hot months trucks have been noted to reach up to 130 degrees in the air and up to 150 degrees on surfaces. These are unsafe conditions for workers. During 2015-2019 107 UPS workers were hospitalized because of heat related illnesses. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/06/14/1182147381/ups-workers-facing-extreme-heat-win-a-deal-to-get-air-conditioning-in-new-trucks#:~:text=Air conditioning systems will be,1, 2024.">1</a></p>
<h4>Two Tier Contracts </h4>
	<p>With a two-tier contract system in place new workers start at a lower wage and over x amount of time they will move to the second tier of wage. This sounds normal at first, but this creates a profit incentive to terminate long-term employees allowing corporations to save on wages as well as taking back non vested pension funds. A two-tier contract also incentivizes the hire of new employees. Newer employees are less likely to support a union thus reducing the bargaining power of the union. <a href="https://www.tdu.org/how_two_tier_contracts_hurt_workers_and_weaken_unions">1</a></p>
<h4>Part-Time Raise</h4>
	<p>Part-Time UPS employees are typically given the most unfavorably hours for the lowest pay. UPS workers have been creating more value for the company while receiving the same pay adjusted for inflation. This has allowed for UPS to bring in record profits during the Pandemic and these profits were not passed along to the UPS workers. The Teamsters hope to gain a new wage for part-time employees that reflects the increased profits as well as keeping UPS workers ahead of gig companies like Uber and Lyft. <a href="https://truthout.org/articles/ups-workers-prep-to-strike-for-demands-that-would-improve-lives-of-over-340000/">1</a></p>
