	<h3>App Instructions</h3>
	<p>The RS app can do a quick approximation of an integral with up to 999 slices. All you need to do is enter the equation you are taking the integral of in y1. You get to this variable by clicking the ‘y=’ button and typing it on the first equation. This is the same spot you would go to type an equation that you are graphing. After this click ‘pgrm’ and then select the RS app. Enter the lower and upper bounds when prompted, and then the number of slices. You will then receive the approximation with rectangles based off the left, middle, and right of selected interval. If the program throws an error for any reason, try to see if you typed in your equation correctly into y1. </p>
